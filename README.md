# Sword-and-magic-arena
Objective:
To create a simple turn-based game with party-based mechanics and a choice of
of locations for the battle. The battle should take place between N and M characters. The battle mechanics themselves can be
be arbitrary, to your liking. 2D or 3D - it doesn't matter, and in general, the graphics are not important (though
cubes, or just text).
Optional Requirements:
* configuration of parameters via Json
* in Unit screens: location selection and the battle itself, as well as the transition between them * in
at least one Next Turn button in the battle
* logic separately from view (separately as a module, project or whatever)
* interactive in battle (abilities, spells, etc.)
* minimum UI
* unit tests
Tips & Tricks:
* describe the json first, then generate the model https://json2csharp.com/
* Rider or other IDE helps
* AI assistants, for example: github Copilot, ChatGPT
Graphics are not important
